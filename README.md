## Hi there I am Muhammad Sajid ( Reasearch Physicist) 👋
<h1>
    I have completed my MPhil in Physics from Government College University, Lahore. My research was focused on “Surface, structural, and mechanical modifications of zinc after thermal plasma treatment,” where I investigated the surface properties and structural transformations of zinc using advanced characterization techniques. I have strong experience in research, data analysis, and scientific writing. I am passionate about exploring plasma physics, nanomaterials, and applied physics, with a keen interest in contributing to innovative scientific research.
